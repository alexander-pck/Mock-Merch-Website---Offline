# Mock Merch Website

**A lightweight, single-file, offline-capable mock merch website built with pure vanilla JavaScript.**

## Overview

This is a **Mock Website for Merch**, initially created as a hobby project. The site is unique in that it is built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**—without any frameworks or libraries. Additionally, the entire website is contained within a **single HTML file** and can be used **without an internet connection**. The project was originally designed to be sent as an **HTML file attachment**, making it easy to share and use without requiring external hosting.

## Features

- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript** – No external dependencies.
- **Single File Structure** – Entire site is written in one HTML file.
- **Offline Capable** – The file can be compiled into a single HTML file and run without an internet connection.
- **Lightweight & Fast** – Minimalist design for quick loading.
- **QR Code Order System** – Orders are encoded into QR codes, allowing them to be printed and scanned automatically for compliance with regulations and simplifications.
